 TODO

## To Do
* Do we have a set of icons we can use? Like warning and "you're good" icons?
* Add series of checkboxes to choose what criteria to grade on
* Command line mode for easier testing (see start.Main)
* Can I use the ARC stylesheet in the application?
* Change AppPane to GUIController type of thing
* Also, application class so I can store values so I don't have to manually select files every time.
